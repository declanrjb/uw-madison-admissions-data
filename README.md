# Data Notes
This dataset uses the demographic categories provided by the University of Wisconsin at Madison, which resembled the categories
used in the federal IPEDs dataset. Madison also provided two composite categories which are included in the dataset. Per their documentation:

**Underrepresented Students of Color**: "domestic (not international) students who identify as African American/Black, Southeast Asian (Vietnamese, Hmong, Laotian, Cambodian), Hispanic/Latino(a), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native." 

**Students of Color**: "All of the students in the underrepresented group and adds other domestic students who identify as Asian."
